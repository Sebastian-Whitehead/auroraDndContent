To include this content:

- Enter the URL of the index file, and click download. 
- Next click 'Update Content Files' and let the program check the entered gitHub repositories.
- Once complete a button will appear prompting a restart of the application. Once restarted all retrieved content files can me managed under the 'Sources' tab

When these files get updated, Aurora will be able to keep content files up to date automatically.

It is required to include at least the core index when adding index files. This will override the content from the bundled system reference document and will have the latest updates. Including the supplements index is highly recommended.

When adding unearthed-arcana or third-party content including the core and supplement index files are required as they will often rely on basic content such as spells from these sources and will not function without the content from the core and supplement files.
